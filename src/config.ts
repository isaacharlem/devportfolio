  aboutMe:
    "I'm an AI engineer and data scientist who recently graduated from the University of Chicago with a passion for building practical, intelligent AI systems that actually work in production settings. I’m especially drawn to large language models, agent-based architectures, and conducting AI research usable in real-world business settings. I’ve worked on everything from fine-tuning and deploying LLMs at scale to designing modern retrieval pipelines and AI agents that interact with tools, code, and people. I’m especially interested in the edge cases... where models fail, where embeddings break down, and where a clever system design can make all the difference. I enjoy asking the important questions and solving hard problems at the edge of machine learning, data science, and software engineering.",
